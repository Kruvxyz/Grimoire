### serif
[ authoritative, older, reliable, trust ]
A serif font is a font with small strokes or extensions at the end of its longer strokes. Serifs have their roots in ancient Roman square capitals, and became widely used with the advent of the printing press. They are often used in books, magazines, and newspapers, as serif fonts are considered easier to read in long-form use cases. Examples of serif font styles are old-style serif fonts, such as Garamond; transitional serif fonts, such as Times New Roman; did one or modern serif fonts, such as Bodoni; and slab serif fonts, such as Rockwell.

### san-serif
[ friendly, approachable, stright-forward, startup ]
A sans serif font is, as the name implies, a font without serifs. In typographic terms, serifs are the small strokes or extensions at the end of a longer stroke, such as the leg of a “K” or “R.” There are several styles of sans serif fonts, including geometric sans serifs like Futura, humanist sans serifs like Frutiger, grotesque sans serifs like Franklin Gothic, and neo-grotesque sans serifs like Helvetica. Sans serif fonts are popular with brands, and are usually easier to read on screens because they have a simpler design than serif fonts.
